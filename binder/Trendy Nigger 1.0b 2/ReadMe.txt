---------------------------------------

This program can join (or "bind") multiple* files of any type into one executable file.

*Up to 32767 files (joining this many files is untested...)

Trendy Nigger Binder 1.0b options are currently limited to:
-Choosing the extraction path for each joined file (the file is extracted with its original filename to the selected path).
-Choosing whether or not to execute the file once extracted.
-Choosing whether or not to overwrite a file that is already at the existing path during extraction.

If you want to edit the stub (pack\crypt\add icon\whatever), just choose "Drop stub to path"
in the Build menu, edit the dropped stub, then join files using the "Build using custom stub" option.
DO NOT edit the stub after binding, this will most likely screw shit up.


Undetected Stubs
---------------------------------------
The "Drop stub to path" option is meant to allow you to create your own "undetected" stub if you want
to. If for some reason you would rather not do this, you may purchase a custom stub from the author (see "Contact" section).
A custom stub will cost you one left nut. If you do not have a left nut, or you are unwilling to
part with your current one, then you may purchase a custom stub starting at $10 USD (Paypal and Western Union
are the only accepted methods of payment). Contact the author if you wish to purchase a custom stub.
