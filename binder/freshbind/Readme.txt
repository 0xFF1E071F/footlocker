Freshbind 2.01 is a file binder which you can use to combine 2 or more files 
into one executable. Bound files are encrypted so should be unrecognised by 
any external application while bound (they will return to their original state 
upon extraction). Files can be of any type, where possible they will be run/opened 
with their default application. Each bound file can be extracted to the windows, 
system, temporary or current directory. In this version there are 3 execution 
options (visible, hidden or none) and 2 registry startup options. Most executable 
files will run hidden when instructed to do so, however this is sometimes not the 
case for other files (test on yourself if you are unsure). 

Version 2.0: 
- Binder rewritten from scratch 
- Stub rewritten in C [[ 9k uncompressed / 4k with FSG ]] 
- Now allows longer filenames 
- Registry startup keys added 
- Unlimited number of bound files
