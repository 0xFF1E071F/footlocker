Deception 4.0
-------------

Disclaimor:
I hereby refuse to accept responsibility for the misuse of this software. You know the drill. If 
you do something against the law with this tool, its not my problem. This software was designed
for installing multiple programs without the need to have a seperate file for each. It even supports
downloading files from the net. This is handy for updates on the web, as well as filesize of the main
exe.

Use:
There's really nothing to it. Everything is self explanatory so go check it out.

Features:
-bind any filetype into final exe
-can download any filetype from the net, without the need to bind directly into the exe
-execution from win/sys/temp directory
-delayed execution, for all
-packable

Notes:
I may release another version with one feature I disabled due to lack of information and tbh motivation (getting laid is a priority).
