What is Reductor?
Reductor is a file binder written in Visual Basic and C++ (Stub in C++).
You can use it to create small 'installation' packages that will drop/run/download bound files/urls. 

Features:
- Small & Fast Stub
- Support for large files
- All bound files and their filenames are encrypted
- Stub will download any given file from the internet and run it
- Specifiy an action for every bound file (extract, register or just drop)
- Built-in Icon changer (supports 32x32, 16x16 256 Color Icons)
- File drag and drop support

Frequently Asked Questions:
Q:Where can i get more icons?
A:You can extract icons from dll/exe files or download icons from various websites, to make sure they are 32x32 256 Colors only you can use icon tools like Microangelo.

Q:What is the register/drop/run action?
A:The register action will drop the file in the system directroy and try to register it (ActiveX) Note that you can also use this action if you just want to drop a file in teh system directory.
The drop action will just drop the file in the user's temporary directory.
The run action will also drop the file in the temporary directory but also executes the file. (files like .bmp/.mp3/.doc etc. will be opened by the application associated with that extension)

Q:The application seems to freeze when binding large files, how come?
A:This is quite normal, the binder application was written in Visual Basic, and it can take a while to bind all files. Leave the binder application alone (even when it doesn's seem to respond anymore)
