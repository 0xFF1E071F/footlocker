insomnia - IRC Bot + SSL | SOCKS5 + uPnP | Ruskill | Botkiller | Chrome Stealer

Came accross insomnia 1.1.3a binary, was kind of Obfuscated,
didn't try to Reflect it (am no .NET coder), you can still give it a try with new Binary non Obfuscated.

Default Port : 443 (Change port @Offset 00002B44 BB01 (01BB = 443))
Other Channels : #usbbk & #usbrk

- For testing purpose only! (OpenSC staff does not handle support for the bot nor the builder, working or not)
- You will need at least Framework 2.x in order to be able to compile the Binary.
